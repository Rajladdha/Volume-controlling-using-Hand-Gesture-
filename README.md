# Volume-controlling-using-Hand-Gesture-
Created Volume controlling model based on particular hand gestures.

This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system to control the volume on a computer using specific hand movements. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system offers an intuitive and contactless way to adjust audio settings, enhancing user interaction and accessibility. It utilizes the camera to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time.

Built with:

-OpenCV: For real-time image processing and manipulation.

-Mediapipe: To detect and track hand landmarks efficiently.

-CVZone: Simplifies the process of working with OpenCV and Mediapipe for gesture recognition.
